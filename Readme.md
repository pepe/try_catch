# REST service with API

This service is being developed as part of the sample solution for
http://trycatch.us assesment.

I am using more exotic technologies, partly for myself to try them, but
mostly that I can show you, it is not programmed by Stack Overflow.

Also bear in mind, I will try hard to have as minimal solution to this problem
as possible.

## It must by API (REST, JSON)

- [ ] It must be secured by basic auth
- [ ] It must contain User mode Â­ with different roles (admin, user, guest)
- [ ] It must limit access to given part of API depend of User role
- [ ] Admin has access to everything
- [ ] User can read all, create all, but update and deleted only his records
- [ ] Guest has only read access
- [ ] There should be at least 2 different models except User
- [ ] Those models should be in relation (1 to many)


## Technologies

- [Roda](http://roda.jeremyevans.net) as router and authenticator
- [Sequel](http://sequel.jeremyevans.net) as ORM
- [RSpec](http://rspec.info) and [Capybara](http://jnicklas.github.io/capybara/) for testing purposes
