# REST service with API

This service is being developed as part of the sample solution for
http://trycatch.us assesment.

I am using more exotic technologies, partly for myself to try them, but
  mostly that I can show you, it is not programmed by Stack Overflow.

Also bear in mind, I will try hard to have as minimal solution to this problem
as possible.

## It must by API (REST, JSON)

- [X] It must be secured by basic auth
- [X] It must contain User model Â­ with different roles (admin, user, guest)
- [X] It must limit access to given part of API depend of User role
- [ ] Admin has access to everything
- [ ] User can read all, create all, but update and deleted only his records
- [ ] Guest has only read access
- [ ] There should be at least 2 different models except User
- [ ] Those models should be in relation (1 to many)


## Technologies

- [Roda][1] as router and authenticator
- [Sequel][2] as ORM
- [RSpec][3] and [Rack-test][4] for testing purposes
- SQLite in memory adapter.
```
brew install sqlite
```
